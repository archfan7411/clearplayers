# How to use current version (were it to work)

Run mcop.py with "python mcop.py path initial_items" where path is the players directory of your Minetest world, such as 
/home/archfan/.minetest/worlds/testworld/players
initial_items is a coming-soon setting to exclude certain inventory slots, as in initial items. It doesn't do anything yet, but the commandline argument is there already.

Open an issue/PR with all the bugs you find :)
